# Problem Statement

Write a program that swaps alternate digits of a given integer 'n'.​

- If the total number of digits in the integer ‘n’ is even, swap the first and second digit, the third and fourth digit, the fifth and sixth digit, and so on. ​​
    - For example, in the integer 564783, there are a total number of 6 digits. Here, the number 6 is an even number. The new integer after swapping this integer will be 657438.
- If the total number of digits in the integer ‘n’ is odd, then the first digit remains unchanged, and swapping begins from the second digit onwards.​​
    - For example, in the integer 512364783, there are a total number of 9 digits. Here, the number 9 is an odd number. The new integer after swapping this integer will be 521637438.  In this case, the first digit remains unchanged, and the swap begins from the second digit. ​
