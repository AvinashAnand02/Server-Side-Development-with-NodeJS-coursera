# Problem Statement

 External Modules or third-party modules are modules that are available online using the Node Package Manager(npm).​

 Lodash makes JavaScript easier by taking the hassle out of working with arrays, numbers, objects, strings, etc.Lodash’s modular methods are   great for manipulating arrays, objects etc.
 Create an application that must use inbuilt, user-defined and third-party modules.​

 1.SimpleCalculator.js file will perform calculator operation ((Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division) of numbers.​

 2.System.js will use the features of 'os' built-in Module.​

	 Create a function to get the name of the operating system of host machine.​

	 Create a function to get returns the number of free memory of the system in bytes.​

	 Create a function to get the information about current user of the system.​

         Create a function to get the information of the hostname.​

         Create a function to get the information about the CPU.​

 3.Use lodash, a third party npm module in the LodashExample.js file.

	Create a function to find a maximum value from number array.​
	
        Create a function to return all values from numbers array 
        which are greater than the second parameter.
	
	Create a function to return all values of employeeName array in capital letters​

	
 Export all the .js files so they can be reused in other programs​


# Instructions

 1.Download and unzip the boilerplate code.
 
 2.Run the command npm install to install the dependencies.
 
 3.Open the boilerplate code in VSCode to develop the assignment solution.
 
 4.Write the logic in **.js** file present in **src** folder
 
 5.Run the test scripts available under src/test by giving the npm run test command in the terminal to test locally.
 
 6.Refactor the solution to ensure all test cases are passing.
 
 7.Zip the solution code with the name same as the assignment name.
 
 8.Upload the zipped solution for submission.
