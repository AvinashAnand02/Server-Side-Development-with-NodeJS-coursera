# Problem Statement - Calorie Tracker

Sam is using a calorie tracker app that helps him keep a record of all his physical activities and his daily intake of calories. The calories burned by him doing some of the common physical activities are:​​

- 30 minutes of cycling burns around 300 calories​​

- 30 minutes of swimming burns around 200 calories​​

- 30 minutes of running burns around 500 calories​​

Sam can lose one pound of weight for each 1000 calories burned. His daily extra calorie intake tracked by the app is 100.​​
Write a program to calculate the number of pounds Sam can lose in a month if he does the above mentioned activities once a week for 1 hour and chooses to do one activity per day.​
