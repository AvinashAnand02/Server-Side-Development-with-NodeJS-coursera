# Problem Statement

In previous Sprints we have used functions to write the logic, now let's split functions in modular code so that it can be reused across the application​

In day to day life we come across Strings so here we will work on Strings, manipulate them and export their functionality.

Write a program to perform String manipulations. Export the functions in the program so that they can be reused in other programs.

# Task

1.Create a function to count the number of characters in the given String.​

2.Create a function to count the number of vowels in the given String.​

3.Create a function to check the existence of the given String in the Specified String.​

4.Create a function to replace a word 'Programming' to 'Platform'.​

5.Create a function to convert the specified string into Title Case.​

6.Create a function to find the largest word (in terms of length) in the specified string.​

7.Export all the functions in the Stringmanipulation.js file so that it can be imported in index.js file.​

8.In the index.js file import the Stringmanipulation.js using require and display the output.​

Note – All the functions should return the output.

# Instructions

1.Download and unzip the boilerplate code.

2.Run the command npm install to install the dependencies.

3.Open the boilerplate code in VSCode to develop the assignment solution.

4.Write the logic in **.js** file present in **src** folder

5.Run the test scripts available under src/test by giving the npm run test command in the terminal to test locally.

6.Refactor the solution to ensure all test cases are passing.

7.Zip the solution code with the name same as the assignment name.

8.Upload the zipped solution for submission.
