# Problem Statement - Users

Registration forms on landing pages are very important and should be optimized in order to encourage the users to sign up for your email list, product, subscription or service. For the todo tracker application users need to register to the application in order to use the services.

Write a program to 
- Display all the users of the todo application
- Display a specific user from a list 
- Add a new user to the user list

## Tasks

1. Create the below functions​
- getAllUsers() – Fetch all the users from the array. Returns a Promise​
- createUser(user) – Add a user to the array. Returns a Promise​
- getAUserByID(id) – Fetch a specific user based on id. If the id does not exist return a message, ‘User Not Found’. Returns a Promise​
- displayUsers() – An async function to create a User and then get all Users​
- displayAUser() – An async function to display a specific user based on Id​
2. Ensure that the display happens only after a user is added to the list. A specific user can be displayed from the list of users available. ​
